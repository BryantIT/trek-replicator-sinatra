# The Food Replicator

Welcome.  This a a basic Sinatra app wrapped in a LCARS framework built from bits and pieces of HTML and CSS.
LCARS stands for: Library Computer Access/Retrieval System and is the fictional computer system from Star Trek originally designed by Michael Okuda.
A big thanks to the designer of http://lcars.padd.online.fr/ where a big chunk of the HTML code came from.
## Installation

Be sure to run `bundle install`.
After that you can access the various parts of this webapp through `shotgun` or any other local server.

## Usage

Start by registering.  This app is as secure as it can be but that being said it is not recommended that you use any username/password combo that you use anywhere else.
